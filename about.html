      <p>I work with wire and sheet metal and fabricate and transformed it using traditional hand tools.</p>
      <p>The metals used include sterling silver, copper, brass, and nickel silver.  I begin by first making sure the metal is thoroughly clean.  Using the metal as my pallet, I draw images and designs using an oil-based pen.  The metal is immersed in an acid solution that eats into the metal, allowing the drawing to remain.  The creative process continues as I cut, saw, and combine metals.  I also solder and use rivets made by me.  I do purchase stones, beads, and chain that is incorporated into my work with other handmade pieces added to the chain.</p>
      <p>To give it a finished look involves a lot of filing and sanding.  This is accomplished with the use of hammers, needle-nose and round-nose pliers, an anvil, punches, shears, and a flexible shaft.  Lastly, this piece is given a patina using a chemical solution and protective coating.</p>
      <p>Designing allows me to share my heart.  I remain the sole designer from beginning to end as a piece is completed.   At the same time, my husband and son are invaluable to me in many aspects  of the business, including hands-on involvement as a piece is made.</p>
      <p>As I call myself a metalsmith, I must confess, this would not have been my chosen medium forty years ago.  But, through six months exposure as an apprentice, I then realized the endless possibilities of transforming a piece of metal.  I’m so glad I was given this opportunity.  It’s been a wonderful life.</p>
